# Portfolio with SQLAlchemy

## Project Description

This is a web application that allows a user to add or edit projects for their portfolio. 

## What I learned 


Here is the knowledge I gained from this project: I learned to use Python for web development, where I got to use: (flask, SQLAlchemy, and Flask-SQLAchemy)â€”these tools allowed me to use python within templates files (Jinja) to use less repetition of HTML and make it more dynamic. Moreover, I was able to build and store user information. I also used flask to create different routes that allow the user to navigate within the web page. Lastly, I learned to keep up with PEP8 guidelines.
